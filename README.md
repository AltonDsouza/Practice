Basic CRUD operations using SQLite.
Here you will find basic operations on update ,delete, insert and retrieving.
You can design your own interface according your needs, i just made it plain simple .
Stuff you need to know:
Cursor: Traverses through the records in the database table.
ContentValues: Used to store a set of values
StringBuffer: StringBuffer may have characters and substrings inserted in the middle or appended to the end.
It will automatically grow to make room for such additions and often has more characters preallocated than are actually needed, 
to allow room for growth.
